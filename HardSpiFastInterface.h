/**
 * Hardware SPI interface to talk to one or two 74HC595 Shift Register chip(s),
 * using the predefined `SPI` global instance. This is currently not meant to be
 * general-purpose SPI interface. For different SPI configurations, it is
 * probably easiest to just copy this file, make the necessary changes, then
 * substitute the new class in places where this class is used.
 *
 * The maximum speed of MAX7219 is 16MHz so this class sets the SPI speed to
 * 8MHz. It's not clear if the SPI speed is worth making into a configurable
 * parameter. Such a change needs to done a bit carefully, because it should
 * be a template parameter so that `SPISettings` is a compile-time constant
 * which allows compile-time optimizations to happen.
 *
 * This class is functionally identical to HardSpiInterface except that the GPIO
 * pins are controlled by digitalWriteFast() and pinModeFast() methods. This
 * decreases flash memory consumption by 70 bytes (HybridModule) to 250
 * (Max7219Module, Hc595Module) bytes. However, if multiple LED modules are
 * used, using different LatchPins, the HardSpiInterface might ultimately
 * consume less flash memory because it avoids generating different template
 * instantiations of the HybridModule, Max7219Module, or Hc595Module classes.
 * Users are advised to try both and compare the difference.
