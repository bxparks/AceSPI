 * Hardware SPI interface to talk to one or two 74HC595 Shift Register chip(s),
 * using the predefined `SPI` global instance. This is currently not meant to be
 * general-purpose SPI interface. For different SPI configurations, it is
 * probably easiest to just copy this file, make the necessary changes, then
 * substitute the new class in places where this class is used.
 *
 * The maximum speed of MAX7219 is 16MHz so this class sets the SPI speed to
 * 8MHz. It's not clear if the SPI speed is worth making into a configurable
 * parameter. Such a change needs to done a bit carefully, because it should
 * be a template parameter so that `SPISettings` is a compile-time constant
 * which allows compile-time optimizations to happen.
 *
 * The ESP32 has 2 user-accessible SPI buses (HSPI and VSPI), and so does the
 * STM32F1 (SPI1 and SPI2). By default, the predefined SPI instance is used, but
 * a user-defined secondary SPI instance can be passed into the constructor.
 *
 * @tparam T_SPI the class of the hardware SPI instance, usually SPIClass
