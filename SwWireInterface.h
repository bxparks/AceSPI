/**
 * Class that knows how to communicate with a TM1637 chip. It uses a 2-wire
 * (Clock and a bidirectional DIO) protocol that is similar to I2C electrically.
 * Both the Clock and Data pins are open-drain which means a single transitor on
 * either the master or slave can pull the line LOW, but a pull-up resisotr is
 * required to set the line HIGH. Because these are open-drain, we must make
 * sure that the microcontroller does *not* actively drive these lines HIGH,
 * otherwise, the output pin of the MCU at 5V (HIGH) becomes directly connected
 * to the 0V (LOW) of the transistor on the device pulling it LOW, with no
 * current limiting resistor. Either of MCU or the device can become damaged. To
 * set the line HIGH or LOW, we set the output level to LOW, then use the
 * pinMode() function to either INPUT (to get a HIGH value) or OUTPUT (to get a
 * LOW value).
 *
 * The logical protocol of the TM1637 is similar to I2C in the following ways:
 *
 *    * The start and stop conditions are the same.
 *    * Data transfer happens on the rising edge of the CLK signal.
 *    * The slave sends back a one-bit ACK/NACK after the 8th bit of the CLK.
 *
 * The difference is:
 *
 *    * There is no I2C address byte, so only a single TM1637 device can be on
 *      the bus.
 *    * The first byte sent to the TM1637 is a command byte.
 *
 * Since the protocol does not match I2C, we cannot use the hardware I2C
 * capabilities of the microcontroller, so we have to implement a software
 * version of this protocol.
 *
 * This class is stateless. It is thread-safe.
